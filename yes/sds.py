sds.py — Student Data System

A command-line application that manages student and academic staff records.
Demonstrates core Python concepts:
    - Classes and inheritance (OOP)
    - File I/O with CSV files
    - External libraries (requests, cowsay, faker)
    - Command-line arguments with sys.argv
    - Error handling with try/except
    - List operations and sorting with lambda functions

HOW TO RUN:
    python3 sds.py add         — Add a new student interactively
    python3 sds.py list        — List all students
    python3 sds.py academics   — List academic staff
    python3 sds.py demo        — Run a demonstration of the system
"""

# --- Standard Library Imports ---
# These come built-in with Python — no need to install them.

import sys      # sys.argv lets us read command-line arguments
import csv      # csv module lets us read/write CSV (comma-separated values) files
import os       # os module lets us check if files exist, work with file paths, etc.
import random   # random module lets us generate random numbers and make random choices

# --- External Libraries ---
# These must be installed separately (e.g. pip install requests cowsay faker).
# They add functionality that isn't built into Python.

import requests     # requests lets us make HTTP requests (e.g. fetch data from the internet)
import cowsay       # cowsay prints fun ASCII art messages
from faker import Faker  # Faker generates realistic fake data (names, jobs, etc.)

# ==========================================
# PART 1: OOP Models (Classes & Inheritance)
# ==========================================
# OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) lets us model real-world things as "objects".
# A "class" is a blueprint for creating objects. For example, the Student class
# defines what every student looks like (name, degree, grade) and what they can
# do (enroll in modules, print their timetable).
