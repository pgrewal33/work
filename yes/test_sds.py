"""
test_sds.py — Automated tests for the Student Data System (sds.py)

HOW TESTING WORKS:
    - We write small functions called "tests" that check if our code behaves correctly.
    - Each test creates objects, calls methods, and uses 'assert' to verify the result.
    - If every assert passes, the test passes. If any assert fails, the test fails.

HOW TO RUN:
    python3 -m pytest test_sds.py -v

    The -v flag means "verbose" — it shows each test name and whether it passed or failed.

KEY CONCEPTS USED:
    - assert: checks that a condition is True. If it's False, the test fails.
    - pytest.raises: checks that a specific error (exception) is raised.
    - isinstance(): checks if an object is an instance of a particular class (useful for
      testing inheritance — e.g. an Undergraduate should also be a Student).
    - setup_method / teardown_method: special methods that run before/after EACH test
      in a class, used here to create and clean up temporary test folders.
